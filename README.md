# Caesar-cypher

Basic Caesar Cypher

This is a ceasar cypher that takes in a string input as a message and a shift key. The characters are then shifted by that key to the left or the right.
It can also take in a string input and a shift key then return two possible decryptions: a right-shifted and left-shifted version of the message
